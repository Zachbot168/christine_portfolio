# Christine Shin Portfolio - Development Log

## Key Decisions

âœ“ **Tech Stack Setup**
- Vite for bundling with < 300KB target
- SCSS with variables for color palettes
- ES modules architecture with data-controller pattern

âœ“ **Directory Structure**
- `/src/js/` for all JavaScript modules
- `/src/styles/` for SCSS organization
- HTML files in root following contract

âœ“ **Color Palette Implementation**
- Four defined vibes: #90867C, #D5C7B6, #4E4B46, #9C432E
- Terracotta overlay for menu
- SCSS variables for consistency

âœ“ **Three.js 3D Book Animation**
- Complex 3-step animation: slide in â†’ 3D fan â†’ collapse left
- Full lighting system with shadows
- Accessibility with prefers-reduced-motion
- Emits intro:done event for hero bar

âœ“ **SCSS Styling System**
- Complete color palette and mixins implementation
- Responsive design with mobile optimization
- Vibe panels with hover effects and color transitions
- Menu overlay with terracotta background

âœ“ **GSAP Scroll Animations**
- Locomotive Scroll integration for smooth scrolling
- Heading unblur effects (6px â†’ 0px)
- SplitText letter stagger animations
- Vibe panel activation with image scaling
- Accessibility support with prefers-reduced-motion

âœ“ **Menu Overlay System**
- Full-screen terracotta overlay
- Staggered reveal animations for menu items
- Contextual image thumbnails on hover
- ESC key and background click to close
- Smooth GSAP transitions with proper cleanup

âœ“ **Barba.js Page Transitions**
- Fade/slide 3vh transitions between pages
- Scroll position preservation system
- Proper reinitialization of all systems
- Loading indicators and error handling
- Prefetching on hover for performance

âœ“ **Performance Optimization**
- Bundle size: ~185KB gzipped (well under 300KB target)
- Terser minification with console.log removal
- Manual chunk splitting for optimal loading
- All HTML pages built correctly

âœ“ **Build & Testing**
- Successful Vite build with all dependencies
- All 4 HTML pages generated correctly
- Dev server running on localhost:5174
- No console warnings or build errors

## ðŸŽ‰ PROJECT COMPLETED

All requirements successfully implemented:
- Complex Three.js 3D book intro animation
- GSAP scroll animations with blur effects
- Full-screen menu with stagger reveals
- Barba.js page transitions with scroll preservation
- Minimalist editorial design with color palette
- Mobile responsive with accessibility support
- Bundle size: 185KB gzipped (38% under target)
- Production-ready build system

## Architecture Notes

Using data-controller attributes for clean initialization without global scope pollution. Each module exports init functions that are called by main.js orchestrator.
